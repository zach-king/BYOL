This is the working directory for my 
following of "Build Your Own Lisp" 
(BYOL) at http://www.buildyourownlisp.com.

Unfortunately, I did not start this repository 
until chapter 8 and so the branches begin there. 

Please note that I take no ownership or responsibility 
for the code found in this repository, as it is credited 
to the author of the above listed website.
